## Introduction
`Netwhat` will allow you to discover the network and to learn about its inner workings. This will allow you to understand how some things work that you already use in your everyday life.

This project is a multiple choice project that will allow you to evaluate your network knowledge and take online quizzes to test your knowledge. When you feel ready to complete the quiz, you can go to [netwhat.42.fr](netwhat.42.fr).

## Review: Questions & Answers

## <summary>What is an IP address?</summary>

IP Addresses are similar to your home address but for your computer. IP addresses are unique series of numbers that identify who you are. An example of an IP address is: 192.168.1.1. You are constantly sending messages to the youtube.server.ip.address and are receiving return messages from the server onto your computer. Each computer have a unique IP address, similar to how a house has
a unique home address.

These IP addresses are sent as a series of 1's and 0's.

As a result, the 192.168.1.1. represents an IP address that has 32-bits (each number before the "." is represented as 8 bits). To slow down the rate at which IP addresses are used up, Network Address Translation (NAT) takes multiple addresses from inside the network and presents a single IP addresses that points out to the Internet. 

The Internet has an exact set of guidelines that needs to be followed by a device to connect to it. These guides are known as **protocol**. Every website, such as www.google.com, has a unique IP address that is masked by the website name.

There are two main types of IP addresses: IPv4 and IPv6.

**IPv4: 66.171.248.170** 

4 groups of numbers (as previously mentioned above) that can range from 0 to 255.


**IPv6: 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334** 

When IP addresses was running out, IPv6 was formed to offer the maximum number of IP addresses that will, in theory, not run out. It consists of 8 groups of 4 hexadecimal digits

In short, IP addresses allow you to communicate with other devices over the Internet.

[IP Addresses. Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_-qWlvQQtY)
IP Addresses are similar to your home address but for your computer. IP addresses are unique series of numbers that identify who you are. An example of an IP address is: 192.168.1.1. You are constantly sending messages to the youtube.server.ip.address and are receiving return messages from the server onto your computer. Each computer have a unique IP address, similar to how a house has a unique home address.

These IP addresses are sent as a series of 1's and 0's.

As a result, an IP address has 32-bits.
